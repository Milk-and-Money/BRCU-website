 	<h3 id="A_day_in_the_life">  A Day in the Life of a Law student </h3>
 	<p>Written by <strong> Katrina Zane </strong> on January 13, 2020</p>

 	<p>When people hear you’re studying law, they immediately imagine courtroom drama, late-night study marathons, and maybe even a little caffeine-induced chaos. While some of that is true (especially the caffeine part), I’ve come to realize that being a law student at Borcelle University is a unique balance of pressure, purpose, and personal growth.</p>
 	<p> <em> Let me take you through a typical day in my life unfiltered and as real as it gets.</em></p>

 <p>☀️ 7:30 AM – Wake Up & Prep for Class </p>

 		My day usually starts early. I’m up by 7:30, not because I’m a morning person, but because I’ve learned that the best way to survive law school is to stay ahead of your schedule not chase it. After a quick shower and a light breakfast (usually tea and toast), I skim through my lecture notes for the day. Sometimes I catch up on the readings I didn’t quite finish the night before (we’ve all been there). </p>

<p> 📚 9:00 AM – Criminal Law Lecture </p>

<p> My first class is Criminal Law — one of my favorites. The professor is sharp, witty, and never hesitates to challenge us with real-life scenarios that make the theory come alive.

Today we debated the difference between actus reus and mens rea in a hypothetical case involving a stolen phone. It might sound dry on paper, but when you’re in a room full of future lawyers arguing both sides with fire and logic, it becomes electric. </p>



<p> 💼 11:00 AM – Study Group Session </p>

<p> After class, I meet up with my study group in the law library. We’re a mix of personalities — two hardcore debaters, a quiet genius who writes the best case summaries, and me, the organizer who keeps our notes in sync. </p>

<p> <img src="images/lawstudents.jpg" alt="Study group session" loading="lazy" width="800"></p>

<p> ☕ 1:00 PM – Lunch Break </p>

<p> Borcelle’s student café is a lifesaver. I usually grab a sandwich or rice bowl and take a break outside if the weather is nice. Some days I eat alone to recharge; other days, I bump into friends from other faculties and catch up on everything from politics to Netflix. </p>

<p> 📖 2:00 PM – Legal Writing Workshop </p>

<p> Legal writing is a beast of its own. Today we practiced drafting case briefs and were reminded (again) that clarity is key. No matter how brilliant your argument is, if it’s not structured well, it falls flat. This workshop has helped me improve not just my writing, but also how I think — logically, critically, and with purpose. </p>


<p> 🧠 4:00 PM – Independent Study </p>

<p> By late afternoon, I find a quiet spot in the library (third floor, corner seat — always) and go over case readings for tomorrow’s lectures. Sometimes I summarize them in my own words, sometimes I just underline like my life depends on it. </p>

<p> 🏡 6:30 PM – Home, Food & Downtime </p>

<p> I head back to my apartment and cook something quick. On heavy days, I order in and just unwind with a playlist or an episode of a legal drama — yes, I still watch Suits, even though it’s nothing like real law school. </p>

<p> 📘 9:00 PM – Light Review or Netflix? </p>
<p>Evenings are flexible. If there’s a major assignment or test coming up, I’ll do another round of review. If not, I give myself permission to rest. Law school is intense, but burnout is real — balance is everything.</p>

<p> 💬 Final Thoughts </p>

<p> Being a law student at Borcelle University is demanding, yes — but also incredibly fulfilling. Every day I feel like I’m building toward something bigger, something meaningful.

To anyone considering law: it’s not easy, but it’s worth it. Stay organized, stay curious, and never forget why you started. </p>

	<h3 id="Building an Electric Car"> Building an Electric Car</h3>

<p>Written by <strong> Dept. of EEE, set of 2019/2020 </strong> on February 5, 2020</p>
<p> What started as a bold final-year project idea became a groundbreaking achievement for our EEE department’s 2019/2020 graduating set. Our goal? Build a fully functional electric car using locally sourced materials and sustainable design principles — and we did it. </p>

<p> The process took four months of intense planning, testing, and countless hours in the university’s engineering workshop. From battery integration to regenerative braking systems, every component challenged our creativity and teamwork. The result was a sleek, two-seater electric vehicle that can run up to 80km on a single charge. We unveiled it during the Faculty Innovation Expo, where it drew attention from faculty, students, and even external industry guests. </p>

<p> This project not only tested our technical skills — it shaped our vision of what’s possible with collaboration, support, and the right academic environment. We’re proud to say we didn’t just build a car. We sparked a movement. </p>
